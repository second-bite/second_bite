# SecondBite

**Deployed site**: <add a link to your deployment here, if you create one>

## Overview
Eating out in the Bay Area is expensive; in fact, the average staple fast food prices in San Francisco are the highest in the country (source). With SecondBite, users will be able to find affordable options to eat out while keeping a history of their preferences.
